Bot Setup

You can add your set of heroes for Nornbear and ATC missions
All you have to do is edit lines 23 to 38. 
NOTE: If your hero isnt listed from lines 34 to 37, you must add the HeroID instead of name.

You can run any build in ATC and Nornbear
All you have to do is edit lines 41 and 42, use the template code of your build.
NOTE: edit lines 48, 50, 52 to the values according to your build
--------------------------------------------------------------

GUI

If you havent selected any missions, the bot will not do missions (OH REALLY?).
If you check "Get New Books", the bot will get new books before start to run missions.
If you check "Turn Books", the bot will turn books after you have done all selected mission.
Number of books: Bot will do only one book at once, until it reaches the value you have set.

ChangeLog:

Added - New version, run only one book at once, you DONT need to setup your inventory like the image above...
remember to check "TURN BOOKS" and "GET NEW BOOKS".
1.2 - Fixed - Bot is now interrupts only lava wave at ATFH.
1.3 - Fixed - GUI checkbox TurnBooks and Get New Books now work properly.
1.4 - Added function - Bot will now display Norn, Dwarven or Vanguard titles. Thanks to Skaldish.
1.4.1 - Added EnsureEnglish() and a fix to the norn title bug when switching armor
1.4.2 - Function GetAgentByLevel() added, now bot targets The Great Destroyer properly

What I added.
Updated The Dialogue so the bot does not launch Cold as Ice instead of Nornbear
Updated Both ATFH and ATC to properly launch the missions
V3 * Fixed an issue with the run not ending after completing ATFH
* Updated Hero Builds for ATFH Making it more consistent and less likely for bonds to drop (If heros are following after flagged set the 3 monks to avoid combat)
